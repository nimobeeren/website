# About me

During my master's on computer science & engineering at [TU/e](https://tue.nl/) I learned to do independent research, becoming fluent in the academic language. This skill was very valuable to me, because it gave me access to the cutting edge of technology. I could apply it in new ways, and create things nobody had tried before.

In the final year of my studies, I found a compelling subject in graph databases. I like how they let you structure your data in any way you like, free from technical distractions. But if we want to have good reliability, usability and peformance, it can be incredibly useful to set some limits on this structure. But it turned out that this was not very well supported, even at a theoretical level. So I decided to write a [thesis](https://github.com/nimobeeren/thesis/raw/main/docs/thesis.pdf) about it.
      
Before my master's, I took a year to gain some professional experience in web development at [Deity](https://deity.io/). I learned React, which let me build whatever UI we could think of. Through building out our GraphQL API, I realized how graphs and schemas made development so much faster and more robust, especially in combination with TypeScript.
      
Besides all this computer stuff, I like to go on walks and take pictures, and sometimes I share the results on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nimobeeren/). I was also on the board of the student photography association [Dekate Mousa](https://dekatemousa.nl/) for a year. Next to that, I read things and sometimes I play the piano!
      
I see myself as a generalist; I collect skills, interests and passions as I go. Whether it's theoretical computer science, machine learning or user experience, I'm always looking for ways to increase the quality of my work and make better informed decisions.
      
I'm excited to dive deep into the next thing!
