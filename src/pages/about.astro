        During my master's on computer science & engineering at
        <Link href="https://tue.nl/">TU/e</Link> I learned to do independent research,
        becoming fluent in the academic language. This skill was very valuable to
        me, because it gave me access to the cutting edge of technology. I could
        apply it in new ways, and create things nobody had tried before.

        In the final year of my studies, I found a compelling subject in graph
        databases. I like how they let you structure your data in any way you
        like, free from technical distractions. But if we want to have good
        reliability, usability and peformance, it can be incredibly useful to
        set some limits on this structure. But it turned out that this was not
        very well supported, even at a theoretical level. So I decided to write
        a <Link
          href="https://github.com/nimobeeren/thesis/raw/main/docs/thesis.pdf"
          >thesis</Link
        > about it.
      </p>

        Before my master's, I took a year to gain some professional experience
        in web development at <Link href="https://deity.io/">DEITY</Link>. I
        learned React, which let me build whatever UI we could think of. Through
        building out our GraphQL API, I realized how graphs and schemas made
        development so much faster and more robust, especially in combination
        with TypeScript.

        Besides all this computer stuff, I like to go on walks and take
        pictures, and sometimes I share the results on my <Link
          href="https://instagram.com/nimobeeren/">Instagram</Link
        >. I was also on the board of the student photography association <Link
          href="https://dekatemousa.nl/">Dekate Mousa</Link
        > for a year. Next to that, I read things and sometimes I play the piano!
      </p>
      <p>
        I see myself as a generalist; I collect skills, interests and passions
        as I go. Whether it's theoretical computer science, machine learning or
        user experience, I'm always looking for ways to increase the quality of
        my work and make better informed decisions.
      </p>
      <p>I'm excited to dive deep into the next thing!</p>
